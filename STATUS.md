## Session Summary

- **2025-12-23**: **Geoff's critique addressed.** Revised paper to remove all claims about fused relatives patterning with interrogatives. Added Geoff's Frankenstein diagnostic example. Simplified generalization: precision modifiers licensed by interrogatives only. Added acknowledgments to Pullum and Goldberg.
- **2025-12-21**: Adele Goldberg feedback: "Brilliant! I find it totally compelling." Loves *precisify* and BCI terminology. Says it's inspiring her to revisit her 2006 chapter 7 work on scope/topicality.
- **2025-12-20**: Full draft from scratch to LingBuzz in ~9 hours. 4 pages, 4 citations. BCI as pragmatic explanation. XeLaTeX for proper PDF text extraction.
