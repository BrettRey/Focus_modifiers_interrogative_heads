# Focus Modifiers on Wh-Phrases: Quick Judgment Survey

**Instructions:** For each sentence, indicate whether it sounds like normal English to you.

- **Yes** = Sounds fine
- **Marginal** = Sounds a bit off
- **No** = Sounds bad

If you answer **Marginal** or **No**, please briefly note: Is it bad because it's **hard to parse**, **not something people would say**, or **ungrammatical**?

**Time:** ~10 minutes
