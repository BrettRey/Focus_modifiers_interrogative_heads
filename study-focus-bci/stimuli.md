# Stimulus Design: BCI and Focus Modification

## Methodological Framework

### Schütze & Sprouse Guidelines

Based on Schütze & Sprouse's work on acceptability judgments:

1. **Acceptability vs. Grammaticality**: We measure *acceptability* (perceived naturalness), not *grammaticality* (abstract well-formedness). This is operationalized through participant ratings.

2. **Scale Choice**: 7-point Likert scale recommended for sensitivity without overwhelming participants. Anchors: 1 = "completely unnatural" to 7 = "completely natural".

3. **Filler Items**: Include grammatical and ungrammatical fillers (ratio ~1:1 with target items) to calibrate the scale and detect inattentive participants.

4. **Latin Square Design**: Each participant sees exactly one version of each item; all versions appear equally across participants.

5. **Instructions**: Ask participants to judge how "natural" or "acceptable" the sentence sounds as something a native speaker might say, not whether it's "correct" according to prescriptive rules.

### Cuneo & Goldberg Methods

From Cuneo & Goldberg (2023):

1. **Backgroundedness Task (Negation Test)**: Measure whether content is presupposed by testing if it projects under negation.  
   - Original: *The cats you mentioned were playing.*  
   - Negated: *The cats you mentioned weren't playing.*  
   - If "there were cats you mentioned" remains entailed, the relative clause is backgrounded.

2. **Two-Task Design**: 
   - **Task 1**: Acceptability ratings for target sentences
   - **Task 2**: Backgroundedness ratings via negation task (independent measure)

3. **Gradient Predictions**: Both backgroundedness and island effects are gradient. Higher backgroundedness → stronger island effect → more degradation with foregrounding modifiers.

## Sample Stimuli

### Design: 2×2×2 Factorial

| Factor | Levels |
|--------|--------|
| **Frame** | Subject position, It-cleft |
| **Context** | Focus-congruent, Focus-incongruent |
| **Modifier** | +*exactly*, −*exactly* |

## Backgroundedness Task Items (Independent Measure)

For each base sentence, create a negated version and ask:

> "Even if this sentence is false, is it still true that [backgrounded content]?"

**Example:**

- **Base:** *The cats you mentioned were playing.*
- **Negated:** *The cats you mentioned weren't playing.*
- **Probe:** *Even if this sentence is false, is it still true that there were cats that you mentioned?*

Response: 7-point scale from "definitely no" to "definitely yes"

## Participant Instructions (Draft)

> In this study, you will read sentences and rate how natural they sound as something a native English speaker might say in casual conversation.
>
> Some sentences will sound perfectly natural. Others may sound awkward, strange, or unnatural. There are no "trick questions"—just give your honest impression.
>
> Use the scale from 1 (completely unnatural) to 7 (completely natural).
>
> Each sentence will be preceded by a short question that sets up the context. Read the question, then judge the response that follows.
