# Micro-Pilot: Focus Modifiers on Wh-Phrases

**Purpose:** Pre-flight check before finalizing stimuli. Test whether integrated-relative degradation is robust and diagnostic of BCI vs. distributional/structural factors.

**Method:** Informal judgment task. 5–10 colleagues/students.

**Prompt:** "Does this sound like normal English to you?" (Yes / Marginal / No)

**Follow-up for Marginal/No:** "Is it bad because it's hard to parse, not something people would say, or ungrammatical?"

**Time:** ~10 minutes per participant.

## Block 1: Core Contrast (Bare *who*)

| # | Sentence | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | I know exactly who called. | Subord. interrog., pre-head |
| 2 | Exactly who called is still unclear. | Matrix subj., pre-head |
| 3 | The person exactly who called left a message. | Integrated relative, pre-head |
| 4 | The person who exactly called left a message. | Integrated relative, post-head |
| 5 | The person who called left a message. | Baseline (no modifier) |

**Diagnostic:** If (1)–(2) good, (3)–(4) bad → relative environment blocks, not linear order.

---

## Block 2: Fused Relatives

Test whether fused relatives pattern with integrated relatives. If yes, head-noun competition isn't the explanation.

| # | Sentence | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 6 | I know exactly what she built. | Subord. interrog. |
| 7 | What she built collapsed. | Fused relative baseline |
| 8 | What collapsed was exactly what she built. | Fused relative, non-initial *exactly* |
| 9 | What she built is exactly what collapsed. | Fused relative, non-initial *exactly* |

**Note:** Items 8–9 avoid clause-initial *exactly*, which can be parsed as sentential adverb.

---

## Block 3: Matched Surface Strings (Interrogative vs. Fused Relative)

Same string, different complement type forced by matrix predicate.

| # | Sentence | Complement type |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 10 | I know exactly what she said. | Subord. interrog. |
| 11 | I repeated exactly what she said. | Fused relative |
| 12 | I questioned exactly what she said. | Fused relative |

**Diagnostic:** If (10) good, (11)–(12) degraded → relative semantics is the culprit.

---

## Block 4: Post-Head Position (*wh- exactly*)

Does post-head *exactly* help in relatives?

| # | Sentence | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 13 | I know who exactly called. | Subord. interrog., post-head |
| 14 | I know which person exactly called. | Subord. interrog., D-linked, post-head |
| 15 | Who exactly called is still unclear. | Matrix subj., post-head |
| 16 | The person who exactly called left a message. | Integrated relative, post-head |

**Diagnostic:** If (13)–(15) good, (16) bad → post-head doesn't rescue relatives.

---

## Block 5: D-Linked *exactly which N* Inside Relative Clause

Test *exactly* on a D-linked wh-phrase *within* the relative clause (not as the relative phrase itself).

| # | Sentence | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 17 | I know exactly which student complained. | Subord. interrog. |
| 18 | The student who complained about exactly which policy is unclear. | RC with embedded *exactly which* |
| 19 | The student who knows exactly which policy to cite got a refund. | RC with embedded subord. interrog. |

**Diagnostic:** If (18) degraded but (19) okay → the issue is *exactly* modifying relative-clause-internal content vs. embedded interrogative content.

---

## Block 6: Prosodic Boundary / Appositive

Does comma/dash rescue integrated relatives, or does it just shift to appositive territory?

| # | Sentence | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 20 | The person, exactly who called, left a message. | Comma-set-off |
| 21 | The person—exactly who called—left a message. | Dash-set-off |
| 22 | The person—who called yesterday, by the way—left a message. | True appositive control |

**Diagnostic:** If (20)–(21) improve but (22) improves similarly → appositive packaging helps, not boundary per se.

---

## Block 7: Controls

**Good (scale anchors):**

| # | Sentence |
|---|----------|
| 23 | The person who called left a message. |
| 24 | I know who called the office. |
| 25 | Exactly three people called. |

**Bad (scale anchors):**

| # | Sentence | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 26 | The person who called left exactly a message. | *Exactly* misattached |
| 27 | I know exactly who called exactly. | Redundant, odd |

---

## Summary: 27 Items

| Block | Items | Key question |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1. Core contrast | 1–5 | Integrated relatives degrade? |
| 2. Fused relatives | 6–9 | Fused relatives pattern with integrated? |
| 3. Matched strings | 10–12 | Complement type matters? |
| 4. Post-head | 13–16 | Position matters in relatives? |
| 5. D-linked in RC | 17–19 | *Exactly* okay inside RC if not on rel phrase? |
| 6. Prosodic | 20–22 | Boundary helps, or just appositive? |
| 7. Controls | 23–27 | Scale calibration |

## Randomized Presentation Order

For administration, randomize across blocks. Suggested order:

23, 1, 8, 26, 17, 3, 10, 16, 5, 11, 13, 7, 27, 18, 2, 12, 20, 24, 4, 9, 14, 6, 21, 25, 15, 19, 22

## Interpretation Guide

After collecting responses:

| Result | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| (1)–(2) good, (3)–(4) bad | Core phenomenon confirmed |
| (8)–(9) bad | Fused relatives pattern with integrated; head-noun competition not the issue |
| (8)–(9) good | Fused relatives differ; integrated-RC problem may be structural |
| (11)–(12) bad | Relative semantics degrades even with matched surface |
| (16) bad despite (13)–(15) good | Post-head doesn't rescue relatives |
| (18) bad, (19) good | *Exactly* resists RC-internal position unless embedded interrog. |
| (20)–(21) improve | Boundary helps (but check if just appositive effect via (22)) |

---

## Next Steps

- If core phenomenon robust and fused relatives pattern → proceed with Family A (integrated + fused relatives)
- If integrated relatives categorically crash but fused okay → reconsider using fused relatives as primary test
- If everything with *exactly* in relative environment crashes → BCI may be right, but distinguish from distributional ban via Family C backgroundedness measures
