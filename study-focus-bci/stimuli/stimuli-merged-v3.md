# Judgment Stimuli: Focus Modifiers and BCI

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-06  
**Change:** Family A revised to use subordinate interrogatives (matching subordinate relatives)

---

## Design Principles (from Cuneo & Goldberg)

### A. Independent backgroundedness measures

Backgroundedness must be measured *without* the precision modifier present. Family C items (negation/discourse tasks) contain no *exactly/precisely*.

### B. Base vs. derived contrast

Always compare base sentences (no modifier) with derived sentences (+modifier), testing for an *interaction*, not a main effect.

### C. Gradience, not categoricality

All judgments on Likert scales. Expect subtle but systematic degradation, not categorical contrasts.

---

## Three Stimulus Families

### Family A: Subordinate Interrogative vs. Relative (Prediction 1)

**Design:** 2 (Construction: subordinate interrogative vs. relative) × 2 (Modifier: ±*exactly*)

**Prediction:** Construction × Modifier interaction; modifier penalty present/larger for relatives.

**Rationale for subordinate interrogatives:** Both constructions are now embedded, controlling for subordination. Main-clause interrogatives could be added as a separate condition if desired.

#### Item Set A1

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | I know exactly who called the office. |
| subord-interrog −mod | I know who called the office. |
| relative +mod | The person exactly who called the office left a message. |
| relative −mod | The person who called the office left a message. |

**Control (modifier targets adjective, not wh-word):**
- The exactly right person who called the office left a message.

#### Item Set A2

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | She remembered precisely what they ordered. |
| subord-interrog −mod | She remembered what they ordered. |
| relative +mod | The thing precisely that they ordered arrived damaged. |
| relative −mod | The thing that they ordered arrived damaged. |

**Control:**
- The precisely correct item that they ordered arrived damaged.

#### Item Set A3

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | We found out just which student complained. |
| subord-interrog −mod | We found out which student complained. |
| relative +mod | The student just who complained got a refund. |
| relative −mod | The student who complained got a refund. |

**Control:**
- Just the right student who complained got a refund.

#### Item Set A4

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | I forget exactly which book she recommended. |
| subord-interrog −mod | I forget which book she recommended. |
| relative +mod | The book exactly which she recommended is out of print. |
| relative −mod | The book which she recommended is out of print. |

**Control:**
- The exactly appropriate book which she recommended is out of print.

#### Item Set A5

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | They discovered precisely who approved the budget. |
| subord-interrog −mod | They discovered who approved the budget. |
| relative +mod | The manager precisely who approved the budget was fired. |
| relative −mod | The manager who approved the budget was fired. |

#### Item Set A6

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | He explained just what caused the delay. |
| subord-interrog −mod | He explained what caused the delay. |
| relative +mod | The issue just that caused the delay has been fixed. |
| relative −mod | The issue that caused the delay has been fixed. |

#### Item Set A7

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | Everyone knows exactly which candidate won. |
| subord-interrog −mod | Everyone knows which candidate won. |
| relative +mod | The candidate exactly who won celebrated loudly. |
| relative −mod | The candidate who won celebrated loudly. |

#### Item Set A8

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| subord-interrog +mod | She understood precisely what the report concluded. |
| subord-interrog −mod | She understood what the report concluded. |
| relative +mod | The conclusion precisely that the report reached was controversial. |
| relative −mod | The conclusion that the report reached was controversial. |

#### Optional: Main-clause interrogative controls

If desired, main-clause versions can be added as a third level of Construction:

| Item | Main-clause +mod | Main-clause −mod |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| A1 | Exactly who called the office? | Who called the office? |
| A2 | Precisely what did they order? | What did they order? |
| A3 | Just which student complained? | Which student complained? |
| A4 | Exactly which book did she recommend? | Which book did she recommend? |
| A5 | Precisely who approved the budget? | Who approved the budget? |
| A6 | Just what caused the delay? | What caused the delay? |
| A7 | Exactly which candidate won? | Which candidate won? |
| A8 | Precisely what did the report conclude? | What did the report conclude? |

### Family B: Cleft vs. Subject-Initial (Prediction 2)

**Design:** 2 (Frame: subject-initial vs. it-cleft) × 2 (Context: focus-congruent vs. incongruent) × 2 (Modifier: ±*exactly*)

### Family C: Backgroundedness Diagnostics (No Modifiers)

These items feed the Negation and Discourse tasks. **No *exactly/precisely* present.**

#### C1. Negation Task

Test whether negation targets the RC content (backgrounded) or only the matrix predicate.

**RC version:**
> She didn't insult the colleague who arrived late.  
> **Question:** Did the colleague arrive late?  
> *(If yes → RC content is presupposed/backgrounded)*

**Matrix control:**
> She didn't insult the colleague during the meeting.  
> **Question:** Did the colleague attend the meeting?

**More items:**

> He didn't contact the client who complained about the service.  
> **Question:** Did the client complain about the service?

> They didn't promote the employee who finished the project early.  
> **Question:** Did the employee finish early?

> I didn't read the article that criticized the proposal.  
> **Question:** Did the article criticize the proposal?

#### C2. Discourse Task

Test how directly constructions convey information.

**Prompt:** Tell me who arrived late.

**Options:**
1. The colleague who arrived late caused a delay. *(RC = backgrounded)*
2. A colleague arrived late and caused a delay. *(Direct assertion)*

**More items:**

**Prompt:** Tell me what she recommended.

**Options:**
1. The book that she recommended is excellent.
2. She recommended a book and it's excellent.

**Prompt:** Tell me which students passed.

**Options:**
1. The students who passed celebrated afterward.
2. Some students passed and celebrated afterward.

### Filler Items

#### Non-focus clefts (to prevent cleft = focus induction)

- It was 1972 when the war finally ended.
- It was with great pleasure that I introduce our speaker.
- It was in the garden that they held the reception.
- It was only yesterday that the package arrived.

#### Clearly acceptable

- The manager who approved the project received a bonus.
- Which employee did they promote last month?
- It was the new policy that caused the confusion.
- The report that she submitted was very comprehensive.

#### Clearly unacceptable

- *The did manager approve the project yesterday.
- *Who which called the office this morning?
- *It was that caused the confusion the policy.
- *The submitted she report was comprehensive.

#### Gradient (scale calibration)

- The person who I think called left no message.
- What did John wonder whether Mary bought?
- The book, which incidentally costs fifty dollars, is excellent.
- Who do you think that saw the accident?

### Fused Relative Controls

To confirm fused relatives pattern with integrated relatives (per Pullum):

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| fused +mod | *Precisely what she built collapsed. |
| fused −mod | What she built collapsed. |
| demonstrative +mod | Precisely that collapsed. |
| demonstrative −mod | That collapsed. |

## Measurement Hygiene (Schütze & Sprouse)

### A. No single-task inference

Backgroundedness measured independently (Family C); acceptability modeled as interaction.

### B. Avoid covert contrast effects

Do not show subject-initial and cleft versions of the same lexical string to the same participant. Use Latin Square.

### C. Treat judgments as noisy evidence

- Model random slopes by item
- Expect shallow effects
- Argue from convergence, not magnitude

## Framing for Adele

> You are not assuming clefts require focus. You are testing whether foregrounding devices behave like LDDs with respect to independently measured backgroundedness. The predictions are gradient, interactional, and construction-sensitive, fully in line with the BCI program.

## Open Questions

1. **Modifier variety:** Use *exactly* throughout, or vary *exactly/precisely/just* across items?
2. **NPI angle:** Add negation conditions (e.g., *It wasn't exactly Kim who called*) to test weak-NPI hypothesis?
3. **Fused relatives:** Separate condition or just controls?
4. **Post-head position:** Test *who exactly* vs. *exactly who* in interrogatives?
5. **Main-clause interrogatives:** Include as third Construction level, or omit?
