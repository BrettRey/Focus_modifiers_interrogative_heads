# Micro-Pilot: Focus Modifiers on Wh-Phrases

**Purpose:** Quick pre-flight check before finalizing stimuli. Test whether the integrated-relative degradation is robust and whether fused relatives / D-linked forms pattern as expected.

**Method:** Informal judgment task. 5–10 colleagues/students. "Does this sound like normal English to you?" (Yes / Marginal / No) or 1–5 scale.

**Time:** ~5 minutes per participant.

## Core Contrast: Bare *who*

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | I know exactly who called. | Good |
| 2 | Exactly who called is still unclear. | Good |
| 3 | The person exactly who called left a message. | Bad |
| 4 | The person who called left a message. | Good (baseline) |

**Question:** Is (3) bad because of the relative semantics (BCI), or because *exactly* can't modify relative *who* for category reasons, or because of head-noun attachment competition?

---

## Fused Relatives

If fused relatives are also degraded, head-noun competition isn't the explanation.

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 5 | I know exactly what she built. | Good |
| 6 | Exactly what she built collapsed. | Bad (if BCI) |
| 7 | What she built collapsed. | Good (baseline) |

**Note:** (6) may have a sentential-adverb reading ("precisely, what she built collapsed") that masks the effect. Watch for this.

---

## D-Linked *which N*

D-linking makes the wh-phrase more "DP-shaped." Does that help in relatives?

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 8 | I know exactly which student complained. | Good |
| 9 | Exactly which student complained is still unclear. | Good |
| 10 | The student exactly which one complained got a refund. | Bad (ungrammatical) |
| 11 | The student exactly who complained got a refund. | Bad |

**Note:** (10) is syntactically odd regardless—*the student which one* is not English. This tests whether D-linking helps at all.

---

## Post-Head *wh- exactly*

Interrogatives allow post-head *exactly* (*who exactly*). Do relatives?

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 12 | I know who exactly called. | Good |
| 13 | Who exactly called is still unclear. | Good |
| 14 | The person who exactly called left a message. | Bad? |

**Question:** If (14) is also bad, the problem isn't linear order—it's the relative environment.

---

## Prosodic Boundary Test

Does a comma/pause improve the headed-relative cases? (Tests attachment competition.)

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 15 | The person, exactly who called, left a message. | Still bad? |
| 16 | The person—exactly who called—left a message. | Still bad? |

**Note:** These shift toward appositive relative territory, which is a different construction. If they improve, it may be the appositive semantics helping, not just the boundary.

---

## Subordinate Interrogative vs. Fused Relative (Matched)

Cleaner comparison: same surface string, different matrix predicate forcing different interpretation.

| # | Sentence | Interpretation | Predicted |
|---|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 17 | I know exactly what she said. | Subord. interrog. | Good |
| 18 | I believe exactly what she said. | Fused relative | Bad? |
| 19 | I repeated exactly what she said. | Fused relative | Bad? |

**Note:** *Know* takes interrogative complements; *believe*, *repeat* take NP complements (fused relatives). Same surface string, different semantics.

## Nonsense Controls

Anchors for the "bad" end of the scale.

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 20 | The person who called left exactly a message. | Bad |
| 21 | I know who called exactly the office. | Bad |

---

## Good Controls

Anchors for the "good" end.

| # | Sentence | Predicted |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 22 | The person who called left a message. | Good |
| 23 | I know who called the office. | Good |
| 24 | Exactly three people called. | Good |

## Summary Checklist

After collecting responses, check:

- [ ] (1)–(2) good, (3) bad → Core phenomenon confirmed
- [ ] (6) bad → Fused relatives pattern with integrated relatives (no head-noun excuse)
- [ ] (6) good → Fused relatives are different; integrated-relative effect may be head-noun competition
- [ ] (14) bad → Post-head position doesn't help in relatives
- [ ] (15)–(16) still bad → Prosodic boundary doesn't rescue
- [ ] (18)–(19) bad → Fused-relative semantics degrades even with matched surface string

## Randomized Presentation Order

For actual administration, randomize. Suggested order (mixing good/bad/test):

22, 1, 6, 20, 8, 3, 17, 14, 4, 18, 12, 7, 21, 9, 5, 15, 23, 11, 2, 19, 10, 24, 13, 16
