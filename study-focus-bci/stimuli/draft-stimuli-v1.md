## Methodological Notes

### Task Selection

Following Schütze & Sprouse (2014), two options are viable:

1. **7-point Likert scale** (1 = completely unacceptable, 7 = completely acceptable)
   - Intuitive; well-powered with n≥30
   - Standard in Cuneo & Goldberg's work
   
2. **Forced-choice** (for Prediction 1, where categorical contrast expected)
   - More powerful for detecting differences
   - Could use FC for Prediction 1, Likert for Prediction 2

**Recommendation:** Use Likert throughout for consistency; Adele likely has established paradigm.

### Following Cuneo & Goldberg's Two-Task Approach

Their innovation: operationalize backgroundedness *independently* of the target construction, then correlate. For your study:

- **Option A (simpler):** Single acceptability rating task on target sentences with ±modifier
- **Option B (C&G-style):** Separate tasks measuring (1) focus/backgroundedness of the NP position via context manipulation, (2) acceptability of modifier attachment

Given Adele's involvement, she may prefer Option B. The stimuli below support both.

## Prediction 1: Relatives Block Precision Modifiers

**Design:** 2 (Construction: interrogative vs. relative) × 2 (Modifier: ±*exactly*)

**Expected:** Main effect of Construction; interaction where modifier penalty is larger for relatives.

### Item Set 2

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| interrog +mod | Precisely what did they order? |
| interrog −mod | What did they order? |
| relative +mod | *The thing precisely that they ordered arrived damaged. |
| relative −mod | The thing that they ordered arrived damaged. |

### Item Set 3

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| interrog +mod | Just which student complained? |
| interrog −mod | Which student complained? |
| relative +mod | *The student just who complained got a refund. |
| relative −mod | The student who complained got a refund. |

### Item Set 4

| relative −mod | The issue that caused the delay was fixed. |

### Item Set 7

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|

| interrog −mod | Which candidate won? |
| relative +mod | *The candidate exactly who won celebrated loudly. |
| relative −mod | The candidate who won celebrated loudly. |

### Item Set 8

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| interrog +mod | Precisely what did the report conclude? |

## Prediction 2: Focus Congruence Modulates Acceptability

**Design:** 2 (Frame: subject-initial vs. it-cleft) × 2 (Context: focus-congruent vs. focus-incongruent) × 2 (Modifier: ±*exactly*)

**Expected:** Three-way interaction; modifier penalty reduced in focus-congruent contexts, especially in clefts.

### Template Structure

Each item: Context question → Target sentence

**Note on Adele's concern:** Not all clefts focus arguments (e.g., "It was 1972 when..."). Using specificational clefts with argument focus to avoid this confound.

### Item Set 1: The cats

**Subject-initial frame:**

| Context | Modifier | Target |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Focus-congruent | +mod | A: Which cats were playing? → B: Exactly the cats you mentioned were playing. |
| Focus-congruent | −mod | A: Which cats were playing? → B: The cats you mentioned were playing. |
| Focus-incongruent | +mod | A: What were the cats doing? → B: Exactly the cats you mentioned were playing. |
| Focus-incongruent | −mod | A: What were the cats doing? → B: The cats you mentioned were playing. |

**It-cleft frame:**

| Context | Modifier | Target |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Focus-congruent | +mod | A: Which cats were playing? → B: It was exactly the cats you mentioned that were playing. |

| Focus-incongruent | +mod | A: What about those cats? → B: It was exactly the cats you mentioned that were playing. |

| Focus-incongruent | +mod | A: How did the students do? → B: Precisely the students I tutored passed. |
| Focus-incongruent | −mod | A: How did the students do? → B: The students I tutored passed. |

**It-cleft frame:**

| Context | Modifier | Target |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Focus-congruent | +mod | A: Which students passed? → B: It was precisely the students I tutored who passed. |
| Focus-congruent | −mod | A: Which students passed? → B: It was the students I tutored who passed. |
| Focus-incongruent | +mod | A: What happened with those students? → B: It was precisely the students I tutored who passed. |

| Focus-congruent | −mod | A: Which books sold well? → B: It was the books she recommended that sold well. |

### Item Sets 5–8: Additional lexicalizations

(Following same pattern with: the restaurants, the proposals, the applicants, the designs)

## Filler Items

### Good fillers (clearly acceptable)

1. The manager who approved the project received a bonus.
2. Which employee did they promote?
3. It was the new policy that caused the confusion.
4. The report that she submitted was comprehensive.

### Bad fillers (clearly unacceptable)

1. *The did manager approve the project.
2. *Who which called the office?
3. *It was that caused the confusion the policy.
4. *The submitted she report was comprehensive.

### Medium fillers (gradient)

1. The person who I think called left no message.
2. What did John wonder whether Mary bought?
3. The book, which incidentally costs fifty dollars, is excellent.
4. Who do you think that saw the accident?

## Fused Relative Controls

To confirm fused relatives pattern with integrated relatives (per Pullum's point):

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| fused +mod | *Precisely what she built collapsed. |
| fused −mod | What she built collapsed. |
| demonstrative +mod | Precisely that collapsed. |
| demonstrative −mod | That collapsed. |

## Negation Task Items (Cuneo & Goldberg style)

If adopting C&G's backgroundedness measure, add negation versions:

For each base sentence, test whether the critical content is negatable:

**Original:** The cats you mentioned were playing.  
**Negated:** The cats you mentioned were NOT playing.  
**Question:** Does the negated sentence deny that those cats exist, or only deny that they were playing?

If negation only affects the predicate (not the existence of the cats), the NP content is presupposed/backgrounded.

---

## Discourse Task Items (Cuneo & Goldberg style)

Present dialogue contexts and ask which response is more natural:

**Context:** A and B are discussing what happened at the park.

**A:** Tell me what happened.

**Response options:**
1. The cats you mentioned were playing.
2. It was the cats you mentioned that were playing.

**Task:** Which response (1 or 2) would you expect to hear first?

Measures how directly the construction presents information.

## Analysis Plan Sketch

1. **z-score transform** all ratings within participant
2. **Mixed-effects model** with:
   - Fixed effects: Construction × Context × Modifier (for Pred 2); Construction × Modifier (for Pred 1)
   - Random intercepts for participants and items
   - Random slopes where supported
3. **Key tests:**
   - Prediction 1: Interaction of Construction × Modifier
   - Prediction 2: Three-way interaction; simple effects of Modifier within Context × Frame cells

## Open Questions for Discussion with Adele

1. **Task selection:** Single acceptability task, or separate backgroundedness + acceptability tasks?
2. **Cleft refinement:** Restrict to specificational clefts, or include temporal/manner clefts as control?
3. **Modifier variety:** Use *exactly* throughout, or vary across *exactly/precisely/just*?
4. **NPI hypothesis:** Worth adding negation conditions to test whether *exactly* behaves like weak NPI?
5. **Scale:** 7-point Likert, or her preference?
