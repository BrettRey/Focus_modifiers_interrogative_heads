# Judgment Stimuli: Focus Modifiers and BCI

**Version:** 4.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-06  
**Changes:** 
- Explicit framing: Predictions 1 and 2 test different constructions
- Modifier frozen to *exactly* throughout
- Family B contexts revised: incongruent contexts keep NP given, shift QUD to predicate
- Relativizers standardized to *who* (human) / *that* (non-human)

---

## Theoretical Framing

This study tests two related predictions from Backgrounded Constituent Infelicity (BCI):

**Prediction 1** tests the core puzzle: *exactly wh-* is licensed in interrogatives but blocked in relatives. Both are subordinate, controlling for embedding.

**Prediction 2** extends the analysis: *exactly + definite NP* should be better in constructions that foreground the NP (clefts) than in constructions that don't (subject-initial). This tests whether BCI generalizes beyond wh-words to precision modifiers on definite descriptions.

Both predictions derive from the same principle—foregrounding devices clash with backgrounded content—but involve different constructions.

---

## Design Principles (from Cuneo & Goldberg)

### A. Independent backgroundedness measures

Backgroundedness measured *without* the precision modifier present (Family C).

### B. Base vs. derived contrast

Compare base sentences (−modifier) with derived sentences (+modifier), testing for *interactions*.

### C. Gradience, not categoricality

All judgments on Likert scales.

---

## Family A: Subordinate Interrogative vs. Relative (Prediction 1)

**Construction tested:** *exactly wh-*

**Design:** 2 (Construction: subordinate interrogative vs. integrated relative) × 2 (Modifier: ±*exactly*)

**Prediction:** Construction × Modifier interaction; modifier degradation in relatives but not interrogatives.

**Note:** The relative conditions (*the person exactly who called*) may show floor effects. This is expected if the constraint is categorical. The key question is whether the explanation is syntactic (linearization ban) or pragmatic (BCI). Family C provides independent backgroundedness measures to support the pragmatic account.

## Family B: Cleft vs. Subject-Initial (Prediction 2)

**Construction tested:** *exactly + definite NP* (NOT *exactly wh-*)

**Design:** 2 (Frame: subject-initial vs. it-cleft) × 2 (Context: focus-congruent vs. focus-incongruent) × 2 (Modifier: ±*exactly*)

**Prediction:** Three-way interaction; modifier penalty reduced when context and frame both support NP focus (focus-congruent clefts).

**Rationale:** This extends the BCI analysis to definite NPs. If precision modifiers foreground, they should be better licensed in constructions that independently foreground (clefts) than in constructions that don't (subject-initial declaratives).

**Context manipulation (revised):** 
- Focus-congruent: Question targets NP identity (*Which cats were playing?*)
- Focus-incongruent: Question targets predicate, but keeps NP given (*What were the cats you mentioned doing?*)

This avoids the "cleft as QUD-reset" confound: both contexts make the NP salient, but only focus-congruent contexts question its identity.

## Family C: Backgroundedness Diagnostics (No Modifiers)

These items measure backgroundedness independently, following Cuneo & Goldberg. **No *exactly* present.**

### C1. Negation Task

**Format:** Scalar response (1–7) to "To what extent does the sentence communicate that [embedded content]?"

**RC version (backgrounded):**
> She didn't contact the colleague who complained about the service.  
> **Question:** To what extent does this sentence communicate that the colleague complained about the service?  
> *(High rating = presupposed/backgrounded)*

**Matrix version (at-issue):**
> She didn't complain about the service to her colleague.  
> **Question:** To what extent does this sentence communicate that she complained about the service?  
> *(Low rating = negated/at-issue)*

**Additional items:**

> He didn't promote the employee who finished the project early.  
> **Question:** To what extent does this sentence communicate that the employee finished the project early?

> They didn't read the report that criticized the proposal.  
> **Question:** To what extent does this sentence communicate that the report criticized the proposal?

> I didn't call the client who requested a meeting.  
> **Question:** To what extent does this sentence communicate that the client requested a meeting?

### C2. Discourse Task

**Format:** Forced choice—which response better answers the question?

**Prompt:** Tell me who complained.

**Options:**
1. The colleague who complained caused problems. *(RC = backgrounded)*
2. A colleague complained and caused problems. *(Direct assertion)*

**Additional items:**

**Prompt:** Tell me what she recommended.

**Options:**
1. The book that she recommended was excellent.
2. She recommended a book and it was excellent.

**Prompt:** Tell me which students passed.

**Options:**
1. The students who passed celebrated afterward.

## Filler Items

### Non-focus clefts (prevent cleft = focus induction)

- It was 1972 when the war finally ended.
- It was with great reluctance that she accepted the position.
- It was in the garden that they held the reception.
- It was only yesterday that the package finally arrived.

### Clearly acceptable

- The manager who approved the project received a bonus.
- I remember which employee they promoted last month.
- It was the new policy that caused all the confusion.
- The report that she submitted was very comprehensive.

### Clearly unacceptable

- *The manager approved did the project yesterday.
- *I remember who which called the office.
- *It was that caused the confusion the new policy.
- *The submitted she report was very comprehensive.

### Gradient (scale calibration)

- The person who I think called left no message.
- I wonder what John thinks that Mary bought.
- The book, which incidentally costs fifty dollars, is excellent.
- Who do you think that saw the accident?

## Fused Relative Controls

Sanity check that fused relatives pattern with integrated relatives:

| Condition | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|
| fused +mod | Exactly what she built collapsed. |
| fused −mod | What she built collapsed. |

**Note:** These are controls only. The fused-relative *exactly* may have a sentential-adverb parse for some speakers.

---

## Measurement Hygiene

### A. No single-task inference

Backgroundedness measured independently (Family C); acceptability modeled as interaction.

### B. Latin Square distribution

- Family A: Each participant sees one version per item (4 conditions, 8 items = 2 per condition per participant)
- Family B: Each participant sees one version per item (8 conditions, 8 items = 1 per condition per participant)
- No participant sees both cleft and subject-initial versions of the same lexical item

### C. Treat judgments as noisy evidence

- Model random slopes by item
- Expect shallow effects for Prediction 2
- Argue from convergence across measures

## Framing for Adele

> The study tests two BCI-derived predictions. Prediction 1 tests the core puzzle of the paper: *exactly wh-* is licensed in subordinate interrogatives but blocked in relatives. Prediction 2 extends the analysis to a related construction: *exactly + definite NP* should be better in clefts (which foreground) than in subject-initial position. Both predictions derive from the same principle—foregrounding clashes with backgrounded content—but involve different constructions. This makes explicit that Prediction 2 is an extension, not a direct test of the *exactly wh-* puzzle.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Floor effects in Family A:** If *the person exactly who called* is categorically bad, we get the predicted interaction but can't distinguish syntactic from pragmatic accounts without Family C.

2. **Cleft relativizer:** Family B currently uses *that* for non-human (*the cats ... that were playing*) and *who* for human (*the students ... who passed*). Standardize further?

3. **Sample size:** Prediction 2 may show small effects. Target n=100+ to ensure power.

4. **NPI hypothesis:** Worth adding negation conditions (*It wasn't exactly Kim who called*) as a separate study?
