Subject: Re: Focus modifiers study — revised micro-pilot attached

Hi Adele,

Thanks for the sharp point about it-clefts. You're right that clefts don't *demand* focus—they just mark a position as focus-available. This pushed me to reframe the prediction: the relevant contrast is focus-congruence within a syntactic frame, not the frame itself. If the discourse context makes the NP actually focused (new, contrastive), *exactly* should be better than when that same NP is discourse-given.

For now, though, I've stepped back to a pre-flight micro-pilot to make sure the core phenomenon is robust before we scale up. The attached 27-item survey tests:

1. Core contrast: *Exactly who called?* (✓) vs. *The person exactly who called left* (?)
2. Fused relatives: Do they pattern with integrated relatives? If so, head-noun competition isn't the issue.
3. Matched surface strings: Same string, different complement type forced by the matrix verb (*I know exactly what she said* vs. *I repeated exactly what she said*)
4. Post-head position: Does *who exactly called* help in relatives?
5. D-linked wh- inside RCs: Is *exactly* okay inside a relative clause when it's not modifying the relative phrase itself?
6. Prosodic boundaries: Do commas/dashes rescue integrated relatives, or just shift to appositive territory?

For each marginal/bad judgment, I'm asking: "Is it bad because it's hard to parse, not something people would say, or ungrammatical?" — this should help us diagnose whether degradation is processing cost, pragmatic oddity, or structural ill-formedness.

Could you run this informally with 5–10 colleagues or students before we invest in a full Prolific sample? Should take ~10 minutes. If the core phenomenon is robust, we can then build the focus-congruence manipulation on solid ground.

Best,
Brett
