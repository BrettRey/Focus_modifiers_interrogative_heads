# BCI and Focus Modification Study

**Collaborators:** Brett Reynolds, Adele Goldberg  
**Status:** Planning  
**Timeline:** January–February 2026

## Research Question

Does the Backgrounded Constituent Infelicity (BCI) principle extend from extraction islands to focus modification? Specifically: do the same information-structure measures that predict island effects also predict where precision modifiers (*exactly*, *precisely*) can attach?

## Core Hypothesis

Precision modifiers are foregrounding devices. They are blocked in contexts where the modified NP is backgrounded—the same contexts that create extraction islands.

## Experimental Design

See [design.md](design.md) for the full experimental design.
