# Focus modifiers and the foregrounding constraint

## Abstract

Most adverbs never modify NPs and most NPs are never modified by adverbs. It's curious, then, that the adverbs *exactly*, *precisely*, *just*, and *only* can modify a few types of NPs including interrogatives (*exactly who*, *precisely what*) but not relative NPs (*the person exactly who called*). 

This project proposes functional explanations for these restrictions. The pairing of precision modifiers with certain NPs reflects a semantic constraint, while the exclusion of relative constructions reflects a pragmatic one.
