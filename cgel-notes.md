# CGEL Notes: Focus Modifiers and Interrogatives

This file collects relevant CGEL passages for the squib on focus modifiers with interrogative heads. The passages are scattered across chapters but converge on the same construction.

---

## 1. Modification of interrogatives (p. 916)

> Interrogatives are among those words that accept *else* as postmodifier, as in [46iiia]. *Else* is semantically like *other* ("who other than those mentioned"); it licenses a *than* complement (*What else than this?*). The adverbs *exactly* and *precisely* may follow the head, as in [46iiib], or precede: *Just exactly who do you think you are?*

**Relevance:** Establishes that interrogatives license a special class of modifiers (*else*, *exactly*, *precisely*) unavailable to ordinary nouns. Notes positional flexibility (pre/post-head).

**Gap:** No explanation of *why* this licensing obtains.

---

## 2. Semantic vs. syntactic scope (p. 912)

> The syntactic interrogative phrase is *whose father*, but the semantic questioned element is just *whose*. Note that *Mr Roberts* is not a possible answer, even in a context where it is known that Mr Roberts is Kim's father. With determiner *whose*, upward percolation is obligatory at the syntactic level, but barred at the semantic level.

**Relevance:** Shows that the interrogative *head* can be the semantic target even when embedded in a larger phrase. Supports analyzing focus modifiers as targeting the interrogative head itself.

**Gap:** CGEL doesn't connect this observation to the modification facts on p. 916.

## 3. Intensificatory tautology (p. 592)

> Multiple occurrences of restrictive focusing modifiers: Multiple occurrences are permitted under the conditions illustrated in [58]:
>
> [58] i *Only Kim has only one job.*  
> ii *And just exactly who do you think you are?*  
> iii *He sacked her purely and simply because he felt threatened by her.*
>
> In [i] the two occurrences of *only* have different foci; the meaning is "Everyone (in some contextually determined set) except Kim has more than one job". In [ii] *just* modifies *exactly*, but the two adverbs mean effectively the same, so this is a case of intensificatory tautology. This construction is limited to *just* + *exactly* or *precisely*. In [iii] *purely and simply* likewise have the same meaning, so here we have coordinative tautology – restricted, among focusing adverbs, to this one fixed phrase.

**Relevance:** Documents the *just exactly/precisely* stack as a restricted construction, consistent with focus-particle combinatorics (cf. König 1991).

**Gap:** Treats this as an isolated curiosity rather than evidence of a systematic focus-modifier pattern.

## 4. Peripheral modifiers in NP structure (pp. 436–438, 347–349)

### 4.1 Overview (p. 436)

> This section is concerned with those external modifiers occurring at the periphery of the NP, mainly in initial position (before any predeterminer) but in a few cases in final position.
>
> Almost all the semantic types involved are found with the same kind of meaning in other constructions, especially clauses and AdjPs or AdvPs. Indeed, it is not always evident from the linear position of an adverb whether it is functioning in the structure of a clause or of an NP.

### 4.2 Scope ambiguity test (pp. 436–437)

> Consider, for example:
>
> [1] *Possibly (,) the best actress in the world will take the role of Emma.*
>
> Here the modal adverb *possibly* can have scope over the clause or over the subject NP. In the former case (where the adverb would most likely be followed by a comma) the interpretation is "It is possibly the case that the best actress in the world will take the role of Emma"; in the latter case (which does not admit a comma) we understand "The person who is possibly the best actress in the world will take the role of Emma". The difference can be brought out syntactically by passivisation:
>
> [2] i *Possibly, the role of Emma will be taken by [the best actress in the world].*  
> ii *The role of Emma will be taken by [possibly the best actress in the world].*
>
> The position of the clause-level adjunct remains constant when we passivise, but that of the NP-level peripheral modifier does not, for it is a constituent of the NP whose function changes from subject to complement of *by*. These examples are structurally unambiguous: in [i] *possibly* can only belong in the clause, while in [ii] it immediately follows a preposition and hence must belong in the NP.

**Relevance:** Provides a diagnostic (passivization, PP-embedding) for distinguishing clause-level from NP-level modifiers. Useful for testing whether *exactly* in *exactly who* is NP-internal.

### 4.3 Six semantic categories of peripheral modifiers

CGEL identifies six types:

#### (a) Focusing modifiers (p. 436)

> [3] i *[Only the corner of the painting] had been damaged.*  
> ii *[Jill alone] has the authority to sign cheques.*  
> iii *He wasn't familiar with [even the broad outlines of the proposal].*  
> iv *We specialise in [principally the following three areas].*  
> v *[The bottom drawer too] needs some attention.*
>
> Focusing modifiers attach to phrases of almost all categories, and are discussed further in Ch. 6, §7.3.

**Relevance:** CGEL recognizes focusing modifiers as a type of peripheral NP modifier. The interrogative construction fits here.

#### (b) Scaling modifiers (pp. 436–437)

> [4] i *We were faced by [easily the worst situation we had ever seen].*  
> ii *Kim had come to [almost the same conclusion as us].*  
> iii *After [hardly a moment's hesitation] he agreed to all their demands.*  
> iv *[Not the least of my worries] is that my hearing is deteriorating.*  
> v *I'd asked him not to make a fuss, but he was doing [exactly that].*
>
> These have it in common that they are permitted with only a restricted range of NPs – compare, for example, \**We were faced by easily a disaster* or \**Not the problem is that my hearing is deteriorating*. The sanctioning element typically has to do with some scalar property.

**Subtypes:**

- **Reinforcement:** *absolutely, altogether, entirely, fully, quite, much, by far, easily* — modify superlatives
- **Approximation:** *almost, nearly, practically, virtually, essentially, quite, much, rather* — modify superlatives and indefinite NPs
- **Negative approximation:** *hardly, barely, scarcely*
- **Absolute negation:** *not* — with superlatives and quantification
- **Precision:** *exactly, precisely*

#### (b.v) Precision modifiers specifically (p. 437)

> **Precision:** *exactly, precisely*
>
> These are found with such adjectives as *right* and *wrong* (*exactly the right answer*); with abstract nouns like *way*, *height* (*He responded in [precisely the way I expected]*); with demonstratives, as in [4v]; interrogative and relative *what*, etc. (*I did [exactly what you asked me to]*). In certain cases they can occur in post-head position: *It lasts [ten minutes exactly]*; *[What precisely] do you want?*

**Relevance:** This is the closest CGEL comes to addressing the construction directly. It lists "interrogative and relative *what*" among the licensing environments for *exactly/precisely*, but:
- Treats precision modifiers as a subtype of scaling modifiers (not focusing modifiers)
- Does not explain *why* interrogatives license these modifiers
- Does not connect this to the "emotive modifier" discussion on p. 916

#### (c) Frequency, domain, modal, and evaluative modifiers (pp. 437–438)

> [5] i *With [invariably the most unconvincing explanations], he would attempt to excuse his erratic behaviour.*  
> ii *I'd rate this as [architecturally the most impressive building in the city].*  
> iii *After [possibly the worst performance of his career], he was booed off the stage.*  
> iv *With [unfortunately very limited qualifications], he has little prospect of getting a job.*
>
> Such adverbs as *invariably* in [i], and also *always, consistently, repeatedly, usually*, occur with heads denoting events or results. Domain modifiers are realised by adverbs such as *architecturally, politically, economically, socially*, or corresponding PPs of the form *from a political point of view*, etc. Modal modifiers (*possibly, probably, surely, definitely*, etc.) and evaluative modifiers (*unfortunately, happily, sadly, regrettably*, etc.) comment on properties expressed in the NP.

#### (d) Quantifying modifiers in predicatives (p. 438)

> [6] i *She is [every inch a philosopher].*  
> ii *The sweater is [all wool].*
>
> These modifiers occur in NPs functioning as predicative complement.

#### (e) Reflexive pronouns (p. 438)

> [7] *[The manager herself] had approved the proposal.*

#### (f) Combinations (pp. 438, 348)

> An NP may contain more than one peripheral modifier, with multiple layers of embedding:
>
> [8] i *Make sure you invite [Jill herself too].*  
> ii *[Even merely a formal apology] would be acceptable.*  
> iii *After [financially certainly the worst crisis this decade], the emerging economies will take some time to recover.*
>
> The bracketed NP in [i] has the NP *Jill herself* as head and the adverb *too* as peripheral modifier; at the next level, the NP *Jill* is head and the NP *herself* is peripheral modifier. A peripheral modifier is thus in peripheral position (initial or final) in the NP of which it is an immediate constituent, but need not be in peripheral position in a larger NP containing it.

## 5. Internal vs. external dependents (pp. 348–349)

> **14 Internal dependents**
>
> Internal dependents of the head noun are dependents contained within the nominal constituent. They therefore follow the determiner (if there is one) and any other pre-head external dependents. Internal dependents can be distinguished in terms of position as pre-head or post-head. In terms of function we distinguish complements and modifiers.
>
> [1] | | pre-head | post-head |
> |---|---|---|
> | i | a. *a [linguistics student]* | b. *a [report on the crash]* [complement] |
> | ii | a. *a [first-year student]* | b. *a [report in the paper]* [modifier] |
>
> Adjectives in pre-head position, as in *a brilliant student*, are traditionally called attributive, and we will generalise this term to all pre-head internal dependents.

**Relevance:** The internal/external distinction matters for where *exactly/precisely* attaches. As peripheral (external) modifiers, they attach outside the nominal, not inside it like attributive adjectives.

## Summary: What CGEL provides vs. what's missing

| Page(s) | What CGEL provides | What's missing |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| 916 | *exactly/precisely* modify interrogatives pre- or post-head | Why interrogatives license this |
| 912 | Semantic target can be smaller than syntactic phrase | Connection to modification |
| 592 | *just exactly* is intensificatory tautology | Systematic focus-particle analysis |
| 436–437 | Peripheral modifiers include focusing and scaling types | *exactly/precisely* classed as scaling, not focusing |
| 437 | Precision modifiers occur with interrogatives | No explanatory account |
| 348–349 | Internal vs. external dependents | — |

### The gap

CGEL classifies *exactly/precisely* as **precision modifiers** (a subtype of scaling modifiers) when they occur in NP-peripheral position, but as **emotive modifiers** when they occur with interrogatives. These are treated in different chapters without cross-reference. The unifying insight—that interrogatives license focus modifiers because they denote alternatives—is not stated.
