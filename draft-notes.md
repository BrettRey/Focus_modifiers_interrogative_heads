# Draft Notes: Focus Modifiers with Interrogative Heads

Payne, Huddleston & Pullum (2010) show that adverbs can modify determinatives in NP structure, most clearly in "precisely nothing," which they analyze under their treatment of pronouns/determinatives and fused determiner-heads (their ex. 12 and surrounding discussion). That move is important for their larger argument about the distribution of adjectives vs. adverbs. But the paper does not address a related construction that looks superficially similar yet behaves differently: focus modifiers with interrogative heads, as in "precisely who," "exactly what," "just which," or "just exactly who do you think you are?" (CGEL).

CGEL already "dances around" this construction. Interrogatives allow special modifiers such as post-head *else*, and they permit *exactly/precisely* both pre-head and post-head (e.g., "who exactly ... / exactly who ..."), with restricted stacking "just exactly/precisely ..." (Huddleston & Pullum 2002: 915-918, 916, 592). CGEL also notes that in a phrase like "whose father," the syntactic interrogative phrase is the whole NP, but the semantic questioned element is just *whose* (Huddleston & Pullum 2002: 912). This provides a strong clue: focus modifiers target the interrogative head itself, not an ordinary noun head. In CGEL terms, only *who* is a pronoun; *which/what* are determinatives that can head fused-determinative NPs. That categorical distinction matters for the modification facts.

I propose an explicit addendum: treat *exactly/precisely/just* as focus modifiers licensed by interrogative heads, not as ordinary NP-internal adverbial modifiers of nouns. For a pronoun head, the simplest CGEL-style structure is:

```
[NP [Mod AdvP precisely] [Head Nom [Head N who]]]
```

For determinatives, the same modifier attaches to the determinative head (or fused determiner-head):

```
[NP [Det [Mod AdvP exactly] [Head D which]] [Head N person]]
```

and for fused-head uses:

```
[NP [Det [Mod AdvP exactly] [Head D which]]]
```

This stays within CGEL's category system (NP with determiners; no Abney-style DP). It also aligns with CGEL's "emotive modifier" observations and with the fact that "just exactly" is licensed only with *exactly/precisely* as an intensificatory tautology (Huddleston & Pullum 2002: 592).

Why not treat "precisely who" as a general license for AdvP pre-head modification of Nom? Because CGEL explicitly blocks pre-head adverbial modifiers of nouns in general, which predicts the unacceptability of *precisely cats* in ordinary contexts. The interrogative case is therefore an exception that demands a narrow license, not a broad change to NP modifier rules. The restriction is also semantically natural: interrogatives denote alternatives or variable-values, so *precisely/exactly* can signal that the speaker is insisting on a precise identification among alternatives. This matches question-semantics work on exhaustivity (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1984; Theiler, Roelofsen & Aloni 2018) and the broader focus-particle literature (Quirk et al. 1985; Konig 1991). Ordinary noun heads like *cats* do not provide the same alternative-set semantics, hence the deviance of *precisely cats* absent a special contrastive or metalinguistic setup.

The upshot is that Payne et al.'s determinative-modifier analysis ("precisely nothing") can be preserved without predicting that AdvPs freely premodify nouns. The interrogative facts fall under a different, CGEL-recognized construction: focus/emotive modifiers of interrogative heads. This dovetails with CGEL's observation that the semantic interrogative element may be smaller than the syntactic phrase (*whose* in *whose father*), and with the distribution of post-head modifiers like *else*. In short, "precisely who" is best analyzed as focus modification of an interrogative head, not as general adverbial pre-head modification within NP.

## CGEL evidence (scattered but convergent)

CGEL touches on this construction in at least three separate places without providing a unified analysis:

### Page 916: Modification of interrogatives

> Interrogatives are among those words that accept *else* as postmodifier, as in [46iiia]. *Else* is semantically like *other* ("who other than those mentioned"); it licenses a *than* complement (*What else than this?*). The adverbs *exactly* and *precisely* may follow the head, as in [46iiib], or precede: *Just exactly who do you think you are?*

**Contribution:** Establishes that interrogatives license a special class of modifiers (*else*, *exactly*, *precisely*) unavailable to ordinary nouns. Notes positional flexibility (pre/post-head).

**Gap:** No explanation of *why* this licensing obtains.

### Page 912: Semantic vs. syntactic scope

> The syntactic interrogative phrase is *whose father*, but the semantic questioned element is just *whose*. Note that *Mr Roberts* is not a possible answer, even in a context where it is known that Mr Roberts is Kim's father. With determiner *whose*, upward percolation is obligatory at the syntactic level, but barred at the semantic level.

**Contribution:** Shows that the interrogative *head* can be the semantic target even when embedded in a larger phrase. This supports analyzing focus modifiers as targeting the interrogative head itself.

**Gap:** CGEL doesn't connect this observation to the modification facts on p. 916.

### Page 592: Intensificatory tautology

> In [ii] *just* modifies *exactly*, but the two adverbs mean effectively the same, so this is a case of intensificatory tautology. This construction is limited to *just* + *exactly* or *precisely*.

**Contribution:** Documents the *just exactly/precisely* stack as a restricted construction.

**Gap:** Treats this as an isolated curiosity rather than evidence of a systematic focus-modifier pattern.

### The unifying analysis

These three observations fall into place under the proposal that *exactly/precisely/just* are **focus modifiers licensed by interrogative heads**:

1. **P. 916** describes the surface distribution
2. **P. 912** explains why the modifier targets the head (semantic scope)
3. **P. 592** documents a special stacking pattern consistent with focus-particle combinatorics (cf. König 1991)

CGEL provides the descriptive pieces; what's missing is the explanatory connection to focus semantics and the alternative-denoting nature of interrogatives.
