# Focus modifiers with interrogative NPs: an annotated survey

Constructions like "precisely who," "exactly what," and "just which" represent a **surprisingly underexplored intersection** of focus particle syntax, question semantics, and nominal modification. This survey reveals that while major reference grammars and the focus particle literature touch on these constructions, no dedicated monograph or paper treats them as a primary topic. The most direct coverage appears in CGEL's treatment of "emotive modifiers" and Quirk et al.'s classification of "particularizers," with semantic explanation emerging from exhaustivity in question semantics.

## Core findings on classification and analysis

The modifier in "precisely who"-type constructions is variously classified as a **focusing subjunct/particularizer** (Quirk et al.), a **focus particle** (König), or an **emotive modifier** (CGEL). The semantic contribution relates to **exhaustivity**—requiring precise identification of the complete answer set. The key constraint licensing these combinations is the **quantificational/variable-denoting** nature of interrogative heads, which makes precision-marking semantically coherent in ways unavailable for ordinary nouns like "cats."

## Annotated bibliography

### Reference grammars

**Huddleston, Rodney & Geoffrey K. Pullum. 2002.** *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language*. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

CGEL provides the most directly relevant treatment under "emotive modifiers" of interrogatives (Chapter 10, §7.13, approximately pp. 915–918). The grammar explicitly lists **"what exactly/precisely"** among modifiers that can attach to wh-words, alongside "ever," "the hell/heck/blazes," "on earth," and "else." These are analyzed as **post-head modifiers** of the interrogative word, though pre-head position ("exactly what") is also attested.

Crucially, CGEL distinguishes **interrogative pronouns** from **interrogative determinatives** (Chapter 5, pp. 389–390, 410–425):
- *Who* (and *whom*, *whose*) are **pronouns**—they function as heads of NPs
- *Which* and *what* are **determinatives**—they function as determiners or as fused determiner-heads

This distinction matters for understanding modification: *who* heads its own NP and can take modifiers directly, while *which* in "which person" functions as determiner within a larger NP structure.

**Fused-head constructions** (pp. 410–425) are central to CGEL's analysis. When *which* or *what* appears without a following noun ("Which did you buy?"), it is analyzed as combining determiner and head functions in a single word. The modifier "exactly" in "exactly which" would modify this fused structure.

*Treatment type*: Emotive/emphatic modifier; post-head or pre-head positioning  
*Constraints mentioned*: None explicitly stated for licensing; the treatment is descriptive rather than explanatory  
*Gap noted*: CGEL does not explain *why* these modifiers can attach to interrogatives but not ordinary nouns

**Quirk, Randolph, Sidney Greenbaum, Geoffrey Leech & Jan Svartvik. 1985.** *A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language*. London: Longman.

Quirk et al. classify *exactly*, *precisely*, and *just* as **particularizers**—a subtype of **restrictive focusing subjuncts** (§8.116–8.120, pp. 604–612, especially Figure 8.88). The taxonomy is:

- **Focusing subjuncts** → **Restrictive** → **Particularizers**: *exactly, precisely, just, specifically, particularly, especially*
- **Focusing subjuncts** → **Restrictive** → **Exclusives**: *only, merely, just, simply, purely, solely*

Note that *just* appears in both categories, reflecting its semantic flexibility. Page **608** specifically notes that "**just may be combined with either exactly or precisely**" (cited by König 1991).

The grammar states that focusing subjuncts "modify the force or truth value of a sentence, especially with respect to its applicability to the focused item" (§8.116). However, Quirk et al. treat these primarily as **clause-level adverbials** rather than NP-internal modifiers—the specific construction of "precisely who" within NP structure is not directly addressed.

*Treatment type*: Particularizer (restrictive focusing subjunct)  
*Constraints mentioned*: These adverbials cannot be modified (*very exactly, *extremely only); position determines interpretation  
*Gap noted*: No specific treatment of combination with interrogative NPs

### Focus particle literature

**König, Ekkehard. 1991.** *The Meaning of Focus Particles: A Comparative Perspective*. London/New York: Routledge.

König provides the most systematic cross-linguistic treatment of focus particles, explicitly listing **"exactly"** among English focus particles (pp. 15–16). His inventory includes: *also, alone, as well, at least, even, especially, either, **exactly**, in addition, in particular, **just**, merely, only, let alone, likewise, so much as, solely, purely, too*.

König's classification distinguishes:
- **Additive particles**: *also, too, even*
- **Exclusive/restrictive particles**: *only, just, merely*
- **Scalar particles**: German *ausgerechnet* ('precisely/of all things')—carrying evaluative components

The German scalar particle *ausgerechnet* is particularly relevant: König analyzes it as having an **obligatory evaluative component** (negative speaker attitude) and notes it can turn polar questions into **biased questions**. English "precisely" may carry a similar but weaker evaluative implicature.

König observes (citing Quirk et al. 1985: 608) that focus particles show combinatorial possibilities: "just may be combined with either exactly or precisely," yielding "just exactly" or "just precisely."

*Treatment type*: Focus particle (with scalar/precisifying function)  
*Constraints mentioned*: Focus particles can associate with virtually any major constituent; combinability patterns exist  
*Relevance*: Directly supports classifying "exactly/precisely" as focus particles; does not specifically address wh-combinations

**Rooth, Mats. 1992.** "A Theory of Focus Interpretation." *Natural Language Semantics* 1(1): 75–116.

Rooth's **Alternative Semantics** framework is foundational for understanding why focus particles can modify wh-phrases. The core insight: both **focus** and **wh-phrases** generate sets of alternatives. Focus triggers a second semantic value (the focus semantic value, [[φ]]^f), which is a set of propositions obtained by substituting alternatives for the focused element.

The parallel between focus and wh-questions is explicit: "When questions are paired with clausal answers, constituents in the answer that correspond to the wh-position in the question are prominent" (Rooth 2016). This **question-answer congruence** means focus and wh-phrases share the alternative-generating mechanism.

Rooth distinguishes two types of focus using binary features:
- **Wh-focus**: [+F, +WH]
- **Common focus**: [+F, −WH]

This shared feature structure explains why focus-sensitive particles (*only*, *even*, *exactly*) can associate with wh-elements: both involve operations over alternative sets.

*Treatment type*: Alternative semantics framework; focus and wh share alternative-generating properties  
*Constraints mentioned*: Alternative licensing constraint (φ ~ k)  
*Relevance*: Explains the semantic compatibility of focus particles with wh-phrases

**Jackendoff, Ray S. 1972.** *Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

Jackendoff's foundational work introduces the **F-feature strategy** for marking focus and establishes **Association with Focus** as a core phenomenon. Focus-sensitive operators like *only*, *even*, and *also* "associate with the focus"—their semantic contribution depends on identifying the focused constituent.

Jackendoff famously observed that *even* can associate with a leftward subject while *only* cannot—a puzzle that subsequent work has addressed. For "precisely who"-type constructions, the relevance is that Jackendoff establishes the general framework for understanding how particles interact with focused/prominent elements.

*Treatment type*: Focus feature marking; association with focus  
*Constraints mentioned*: Asymmetries between particles in leftward association  
*Relevance*: Foundational; does not directly address wh-combinations

**Beaver, David I. & Brady Z. Clark. 2008.** *Sense and Sensitivity: How Focus Determines Meaning*. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.

Beaver and Clark propose the **QFC theory**, distinguishing three types of focus sensitivity:
1. **Quasi association**: Pragmatic inference
2. **Free association**: Resolution of a free variable
3. **Conventional association**: Grammatical dependency on the Current Question Under Discussion

Their analysis of **exclusives** (*only*, *just*, *merely*) is particularly relevant. All exclusives contribute an **at-issue upper bound** on viable answers (expressible with "at most") while signaling that a **lower bound** (expressible with "at least") is taken for granted.

Notably, *just* excludes **less robustly** than *only* and *merely*, with a preference for rank-order readings. This helps explain why "just who" has a slightly different pragmatic feel than "only who" would (were it grammatical in the same position).

*Treatment type*: QFC theory; exclusives analyzed via upper/lower bounds  
*Constraints mentioned*: Variation in exclusion strength among particles  
*Relevance*: Tangential—focuses on *only/just/merely* but not on precisifying uses

### Semantics of questions and exhaustivity

**Groenendijk, Jeroen & Martin Stokhof. 1984.** *Studies on the Semantics of Questions and the Pragmatics of Answers*. Doctoral dissertation, University of Amsterdam.

Groenendijk and Stokhof develop **partition semantics** for questions, with the crucial notion of **strong exhaustivity**. Under strong exhaustivity, knowing "who called" means knowing *exactly* who called and who didn't—both the positive and negative extensions.

This is directly relevant to "exactly who" constructions: "John knows exactly who called" = John knows the true exhaustive answer. The contribution of "exactly" is to **force the strongly exhaustive reading**, requiring identification of the complete answer.

*Treatment type*: Partition semantics; exhaustivity  
*Constraints mentioned*: Strong vs. weak exhaustivity distinction  
*Relevance*: Directly explains the semantic contribution of "exactly" with embedded questions

**Theiler, Nadine, Floris Roelofsen & Maria Aloni. 2018.** "A Uniform Semantics for Declarative and Interrogative Complements." *Journal of Semantics* 35(3): 409–466.

This paper explicitly discusses "exactly who" in embedded questions: "Under a strongly exhaustive (SE) reading, (2) is true just in case John knows **exactly who** called and who didn't." The paper also discusses **explicit exhaustivity markers** cross-linguistically, including Dutch *allemaal*, which forces exhaustive interpretations.

*Treatment type*: Inquisitive semantics; exhaustivity  
*Canonical example*: "John knows exactly who called"  
*Relevance*: One of the few sources explicitly using "exactly who" as an example

### Syntactic treatments

**Büring, Daniel & Katharina Hartmann. 2001.** "The Syntax and Semantics of Focus-Sensitive Particles in German." *Natural Language & Linguistic Theory* 19: 229–281.

Büring and Hartmann propose the **Particle Theory**: focus particles adjoin **only to non-arguments**—specifically VPs, IPs, APs, and root CPs—but **never to argument DPs/NPs or argument CPs**. If correct, this predicts that "exactly" in "exactly who" cannot adjoin directly to the wh-NP as an argument.

**Reformulating in NP terms** (rejecting DP analysis): The constraint becomes that focus particles adjoin to non-argument NPs or to verbal/clausal projections. This may be satisfied in questions because fronted wh-phrases in Spec-CP are not in argument position at surface structure.

*Treatment type*: Structural constraint on FP adjunction  
*Constraints mentioned*: FPs adjoin only to non-arguments  
*Relevance*: Predicts restrictions but is contested (see Reis 2005)

**Hinterwimmer, Stefan. 2010.** "On Apparent NP-Internal Focus Particles in German." *The Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics* 13: 1–29.

Hinterwimmer argues that apparent NP-internal focus particles actually adjoin to **extra non-nominal functional projections** within the nominal domain. This reconciles apparent counterexamples with Büring and Hartmann's theory. Even when particles appear inside NPs, they adjoin to functional heads rather than directly to N.

*Treatment type*: FPs adjoin to functional projections within nominal domain  
*Relevance*: Suggests modification of interrogatives may involve adjunction to functional structure

## Constraints: why "precisely who" but not "*precisely cats"

The literature suggests several converging explanations:

**Semantic compatibility**: Interrogative pronouns denote **variables over individuals** (Karttunen 1977; Hamblin 1973). "Precisely/exactly/just" **restrict the range or identity** of possible values. Regular nouns like "cats" denote sets, not variables—precision-marking is semantically anomalous because there is no variable to precisify.

**Quantificational status**: Wh-words are inherently quantificational (binding a variable). Focus particles and degree modifiers naturally associate with quantifiers: "almost everyone," "nearly all," "absolutely no one." Ordinary nouns lack this quantificational character.

**Focus association**: Wh-words are **inherently focal** (bearing [+wh] and often [+F] features in Alternative Semantics). Focus particles require a focus associate. Regular NPs are not inherently focal and thus fail to provide the necessary association site.

**Structural licensing**: Per Büring and Hartmann, focus particles adjoin to non-arguments. Fronted wh-phrases in Spec-CP are displaced from argument position. By contrast, "cats" as a subject or object occupies argument position, blocking FP adjunction.

## Canonical examples from the literature

| Example | Source | Context |
|---------|--------|---------|
| "What exactly are they here for?" | CGEL (2002), Ch. 10 | Emotive modifiers |
| "John knows exactly who called" | Theiler et al. (2018) | Strong exhaustivity |
| "Precisely which candidate do you support?" | Constructed (standard) | Determinative + N |
| "Just who do you think you are?" | König (1991), examples | Rhetorical/emphatic |
| "Exactly what do you mean?" | Quirk et al. (1985), implicit | Particularizer use |

## Synthesis and research gaps

The construction "exactly/precisely/just + wh-word" falls at an intersection that no single source treats comprehensively:

**CGEL** provides the correct descriptive framework (emotive modifiers, pronoun vs. determinative distinction, fused-head constructions) but offers no explanatory account of licensing.

**Quirk et al.** classifies the particles correctly (particularizers) but treats them as clause-level adverbials rather than NP-internal modifiers.

**König** establishes "exactly" as a focus particle and notes combinatorial patterns but does not specifically address wh-combinations.

**Question semantics** (Groenendijk & Stokhof; Theiler et al.) explains the semantic contribution—forcing exhaustive readings—but does not address the syntactic structure.

**Focus particle syntax** (Büring & Hartmann; Hinterwimmer) provides structural constraints but does not directly analyze interrogative modification.

A dedicated treatment would need to integrate: (1) CGEL's categorial distinctions; (2) the semantic explanation from exhaustivity/alternative semantics; (3) structural constraints on focus particle placement; and (4) the parallel with quantifier modification ("almost everyone"). This represents a genuine gap suitable for a dedicated article or dissertation chapter.

---

## Summary in CGEL terminology

Using CGEL's framework exclusively: *precisely*, *exactly*, and *just* function as **adverb modifiers** of interrogative heads. When modifying the pronoun *who*, they are **pre-head modifiers** within NP (parallel to "almost everyone"). When modifying the determinative *which* in fused-head uses ("exactly which"), they modify the fused determiner-head. When *which* is followed by a noun ("exactly which person"), the adverb modifies the determinative functioning as determiner of the larger NP.

The licensing is tied to the **quantificational/variable-denoting** semantics of interrogatives: precision-marking makes sense for elements that range over alternatives. CGEL's "emotive modifier" label captures the emphatic function but does not provide the underlying explanation, which must be sought in the semantics of focus and alternatives.
