# Empirical Follow-up: Goldberg Collaboration

**Status:** Collaboration offered; stimuli needed
**Collaborator:** Adele Goldberg (Princeton)
**Timeline:** Data collection late Jan / early Feb 2026

---

## Background

Following the Glossa squib submission, Adele offered to collect data testing whether BCI (Backgrounded Constituent Infelicity) predicts where *exactly/precisely* can attach.

## Proposed Predictions

### Prediction 1 (Negative): Relatives block precision modifiers
- *the person exactly who called* — blocked
- Same backgroundedness that makes relatives islands for extraction should block foregrounding via precision modifiers

### Prediction 2 (Gradient): Clefts > Subject-initial
- *It was exactly the cats you mentioned who were playing* — better
- *Exactly the cats you mentioned were playing* — worse
- Clefts explicitly foreground the post-copular constituent

## Adele's Question (Dec 24)

She raises a valid concern about Prediction 2:

> Not all it-clefts focus arguments:
> - *It was 1972 when the war finally ended.*
> - *It is with great pleasure that I introduce Brett Reynolds.*
>
> If that's true, then it might be that both clefts and subjects allow but don't demand focused arguments?

**Needs clarifying:** May need to narrow to specificational clefts, or reframe the gradient prediction.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Respond to Adele: clarify cleft prediction + raise NPI hypothesis
- [ ] Design stimuli
- [ ] Send stimuli to Adele (target: mid-January)
- [ ] Data collection (late Jan / early Feb)
- [ ] Analysis

## Theoretical Questions

### Are *exactly/precisely* NPIs? (Dec 25)

Interrogatives are NPI licensors. With proper names (not numerals, where *exactly* modifies within the DP), there's a gradient:

- *It wasn't exactly Kim who called.* — negation licenses ✓
- *It was exactly Kim who called.* — cleft helps ?
- *Exactly Kim called.* — bare assertion, worst ??

This looks like an NPI gradient. If *exactly* (as focus modifier on names/interrogatives) is a weak NPI, that interacts with the BCI account: both negation and interrogatives are DE environments that license NPIs.

**To investigate:** Does NPI-hood explain the interrogative licensing, or is it orthogonal to BCI?

## Correspondence

- **Dec 20**: Brett sends squib to Adele
- **Dec 21**: Adele responds "Brilliant! I find it totally compelling."
- **Dec 24**: Brett proposes collaboration; Adele agrees, raises cleft question
