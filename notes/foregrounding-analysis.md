# Foregrounding Analysis: Why *exactly who* but not *\*the person exactly who*

This file develops the discourse-functional explanation for the distribution of *exactly/precisely/just* with interrogatives, drawing on the Backgrounded Constituent Infelicity (BCI) framework.

---

## The constraint

*Exactly/precisely/just* can modify wh-phrases in some constructions but not others:

| Construction | Example | Status |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Wh-question | *Exactly who called?* | ✓ |
| Free/fused relative | *I did exactly what you asked.* | ✓ |
| Integrated relative | *\*The person exactly who called...* | ✗ |

---

## The BCI principle

Cuneo & Goldberg (2023) propose:

> It is infelicitous for a speaker to simultaneously foreground and background the same constituent.

This explains island effects: LDD constructions (wh-questions, relative clauses) **foreground** a constituent by fronting it; if the base construction **backgrounds** that constituent, a clash results.

---

## Applying BCI to *exactly who*

### *Exactly* as a foregrounding operator

*Exactly/precisely* demands **precise identification**—it makes the wh-element prominent, focusing attention on exhaustive resolution. This is a foregrounding function.

Evidence:
- Semantically, *exactly* signals strong exhaustivity (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1984; Theiler et al. 2018)
- Pragmatically, *exactly* increases the prominence/at-issueness of the wh-element
- The "emotive" force noted by CGEL (p. 916) is a foregrounding effect

### Information structure of wh-constructions

| Construction | wh-element status | Compatible with foregrounding? |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Wh-question** | Foregrounded—the queried element is maximally at-issue | ✓ |
| **Free relative** | At-issue—identifies the referent | ✓ |
| **Integrated relative** | Backgrounded—presupposed, modifying an already-established antecedent | ✗ |

### The clash

In integrated relatives, the wh-word (*who/which*) introduces **backgrounded content**—the relative clause is presupposed. Adding *exactly* attempts to **foreground** that element. This creates a BCI violation:

> \*The person **exactly who** called... 
> 
> = Trying to foreground (via *exactly*) content that is structurally backgrounded (via integrated relative)

---

## Support from it-cleft asymmetries

Winckel et al. (2025) show that even within presupposed clauses, information structure is non-uniform:
- Subjects are more backgrounded than VPs
- Extraction from (backgrounded) subjects is worse than extraction from (foregrounded) VPs

This supports the idea that foregrounding/backgrounding is **gradient** and **construction-specific**, not a binary feature of clause types.

---

## The parallel with LDD constraints

| Phenomenon | Foregrounding element | Backgrounding element | Result |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Island effects | LDD fronting | Island construction | Clash |
| *\*exactly who* in relatives | *exactly* | Integrated relative | Clash |

The mechanism is the same: you can't simultaneously highlight (foreground) and suppress (background) the same constituent.

---

## Summary

**Syntactic description** (CGEL): *Exactly/precisely/just* are peripheral modifiers of NPs headed by interrogatives.

**Functional explanation** (BCI): These modifiers foreground; they are compatible only with wh-elements that are themselves foregrounded (questions, free relatives), not with wh-elements in backgrounded positions (integrated relatives).
