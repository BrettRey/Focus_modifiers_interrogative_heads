# Advisory Board

Virtual advisors for squib review via multi-agent workflow.

## CGEL/Syntax Board

| Advisor | Expertise | Key Question |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Geoffrey Pullum** | CGEL co-author, determinatives, category distinctions | Does the analysis stay true to CGEL's category system? |
| **John Payne** | Payne et al. 2010, adjective/adverb distribution | Does this extend rather than contradict the original analysis? |
| **Adele Goldberg** | Construction Grammar, form-meaning pairings, licensed constructions | Is this a construction worth naming? What predicts its distribution? |

## Semantics Board

| Advisor | Expertise | Key Question |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Ekkehard König** | Focus particles, *exactly/precisely/just* combinatorics | Is the focus-particle analysis semantically grounded? |
| **Floris Roelofsen** | Question semantics, exhaustivity, *exactly who* | Does the alternative-set explanation hold up? |

## Squib Craft

| Advisor | Expertise | Key Question |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Generic Snippets Reviewer** | Tight argumentation, 2-page clarity | Can this be said in fewer words? What's the one sentence takeaway? |

## Usage

For a squib this size, run 2 advisors max: one CGEL (Pullum or Payne), one semantics (König or Roelofsen). Save craft review for final polish.
